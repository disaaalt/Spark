ðŸ’¥ A Discord bot template (WIP)<br />
Spend less time on setup and focus on more important features.

This repository contains a basic scaffold of a Discord bot for developers, and I mostly use it personally. 

The ending product should include easy and friendly ways to make new features, as well as exposing the entire codebase if people need to modify it. This template already includes a basic command, event and "condition" (a system that controls command execution).

This template was written in TypeScript, using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library. TypeScript [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) are very commonly used within this template.

## TODO
- [x] Slash commands
- [ ] Custom error handlers
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Context menus
