A Discord bot template (WIP)

This repository contains a basic scaffold of a Discord bot for developers, and I mostly use it for my personal use. Spend less time on setup and focus on more important features.

This template was written in TypeScript, using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library. TypeScript [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) are very commonly used within this template.

I have already included a basic command, event and "condition" (a system that controls command execution). This template is still WIP - please do not use it for production.

## TODO:
- [ ] Slash commands
- [ ] Custom error handlers
- [ ] Tests
